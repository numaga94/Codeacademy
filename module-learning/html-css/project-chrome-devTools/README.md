# Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

In this project, you’ll build a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using the tools on your own
computer. This project will provide you with less guidance than previous projects. You should expect to use the
internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

At a high-level, this project will require the following:

- A folder structure that makes sense for the project
- An HTML file
- A CSS file

To successfully complete the project, you’ll require the following images:

- [Image 4](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/finnish.jpeg)

The rest of the page’s styling (font sizes, colors, etc.) is outlined in the following design spec, which is a standard
document you’d expect to receive as a freelance web developer:

Use the website to the right and the resources above to guide you through the project.

This project is intended to be completed on your own computer. To successfully finish the project, make sure to download
the images that are linked above. There’s no single, correct way to complete this project, so experiment and have fun!
